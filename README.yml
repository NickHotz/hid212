        With the amount of data created everyday reaching exorbitant limits
        and a push for analysis across all major fields gaining traction, we need
        an advanced framework to analyze the large data. Hadoop is such a framework
        for developing distribution applications. MapReduce is an application model
        for Hadoop. Word count is a small analysis that can be done usingMapReduce.
        It can also be used for complex tasks like search.
