        With the amount of data created everyday reaching exorbitant limits
        and a push for analysis across all major fields gaining traction, we need
        an advanced framework to analyze the large data. Hadoop is such a framework
        for developing distribution applications. MapReduce is an application model
        for Hadoop. Word count is a small analysis that can be done usingMapReduce.
        It can also be used for complex tasks like search.

        With increased resolution and quantity of images and videos stored everyday,
        there is a need for better data storage techniques and processing for such data.
        The algorithms for processing such exorbitant amount of data are usually complex
        and require a lot of computation power. This forces the use of a distributed 
        environment for better storage and faster computation using application model like
        MapReduce.
