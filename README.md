   title: Big Data Analysis using MapReduce
   abstract: >
       With the amount of data created everyday reaching exorbitant
       limits and a push for analysis across all major fields gaining
       traction, we need an advanced framework to analyze the large
       data. Hadoop is such a framework for developing distribution
       applications. MapReduce is an application model for
       Hadoop. Word count is a small analysis that can be done
       usingMapReduce. It can also be used for complex tasks like
       'search'.
