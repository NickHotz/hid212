   title: Big Data in Image Processing
   abstract: >
       With increased resolution and quantity of images and videos stored everyday, 
       there is a need for better data storage techniques and processing for such data.
       The algorithms for processing such exorbitant amount of data are usually complex
       and require a lot of computation power. This forces the use of a distributed environment
       for better storage and faster computation using application model like MapReduce.
