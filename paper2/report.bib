 abstract = {This paper examines a change in business practices in the pharmaceutical manufacturer-to-distributor supply chain, a change that essentially forced pharmaceutical distributors to maintain lower inventories. This change also provided pharmaceutical manufacturers with information about distributor customer demand and inventories that had previously been withheld from them. Supply chain theory and practice in other industries suggest that by improving decision making and implementation, companies can operate with substantially lower inventories. This happened in pharmaceutical distribution when a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation led manufacturers to force distributors to operate with less inventory. Theory and practice further suggest that manufacturers who are provided with relevant information that they did not have previously would take advantage of this information to reduce their inventories. This evidently did not happen in pharmaceutical manufacturing. We contend that pharmaceutical manufacturers either do not know how to take advantage of such information or they do not care.},

    abstract = { Public health authorities have described, with growing alarm, an unprecedented increase in morbidity and mortality associated with use of opioid pain relievers (OPRs). Efforts to address the opioid crisis have focused mainly on reducing nonmedical OPR use. Too often overlooked, however, is the need for preventing and treating opioid addiction, which occurs in both medical and nonmedical OPR users. Overprescribing of OPRs has led to a sharp increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction, which in turn has been associated with a rise in overdose deaths and heroin use. A multifaceted public health approach that utilizes primary, secondary, and tertiary opioid addiction prevention strategies is required to effectively reduce opioid-related morbidity and mortality. We describe the scope of this public health crisis, its historical context, contributing factors, and lines of evidence indicating the role of addiction in exacerbating morbidity and mortality, and we provide a framework for interventions to address the epidemic of opioid addiction. }

The technology has matured from its specialized tracking and retail uses to a systemic part of supply chain management in international pharmaceutical production and distribution. Counterfeit drugs, however, remain a significant challenge for governments, pharmaceutical companies, clinicians, and patients and the use of RFID to track these compounds represents an opportunity for development. This paper discusses the medical, technological, and economic factors that support widespread adoption of RFID technology in the pharmaceutical industry in an effort to prevent counterfeit medicines from harming patients and brand equity.",
